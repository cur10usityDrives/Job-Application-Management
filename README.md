# Job Application Management System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a job application management system that allows administrators to efficiently manage 
job applications for a company. The system supports various operations such as adding new applications, searching 
for applications based on specific criteria, updating existing applications, and deleting applications from the system.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for managing job applications. 
By automating the application management process, the system helps streamline administrative tasks, improves 
organization, and enhances the overall recruitment process for the company.

## Structure
The project follows an object-oriented approach to software design, with the following key components:
- **Applicant:** Represents an individual job applicant and contains personal information, language skills, educational background, work experience, and major skills.
- **Application:** Manages a collection of applicants and provides functionalities for adding, searching, updating, and deleting applications.
- **Enums:** Define enumerations for emergency contact levels and education levels.
- **InputFormatter:** Provides utility methods for formatting input data such as phone numbers, email addresses, and dates.

## Development Process
The development process for this project involves the following steps:
1. **Requirements Analysis:** Define the functional and non-functional requirements of the job application management system.
2. **Design:** Design the system architecture, class structure, and interactions between components.
3. **Implementation:** Write the code according to the design specifications, ensuring proper encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.
4. **Testing:** Perform unit testing to validate the functionality of individual classes and methods, as well as integration testing to ensure the system works as expected as a whole.
5. **Refinement:** Iterate on the implementation based on testing feedback, code reviews, and user feedback to improve code quality and system performance.
